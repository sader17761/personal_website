		<h1>Grilling Tips and Techniques</h1>
		
		<div class="grillingtips_block">
			<div class="grillingtips_info">
				<h2>Direct Method</h2>
				<p>The Direct Method is similar to broiling. Food is cooked directly over the heat source. 
				For even cooking, food should be turned once halfway through the grilling time. 
				Use the Direct method for foods that take less than 25 minutes to cook: like steaks, 
				chops, kabobs, sausages and vegetables. Direct cooking is also necessary to sear meats. 
				Searing creates that wonderful crisp, caramelized texture where the food hits the grate. 
				It also adds nice grill marks and flavor to the entire food surface. Steaks, chops, chicken pieces, 
				and larger cuts of meat all benefit from searing.</p>

				<p>To grill by the Direct Method on a charcoal grill, spread prepared coals evenly across the 
				charcoal grate. Set the cooking grate over the coals and place food on the cooking grate. 
				Place the lid on the grill and lift it only to turn food or to test for doneness at the end 
				of the recommended cooking time.</p>

				<p>To grill by the Direct Method on a gas grill, preheat the grill with all burners on High. 
				Place the food on the cooking grate, then adjust all burners to the temperature noted in the recipe. 
				Close the lid of the grill and lift it only to turn food or to test for doneness at the end of the 
				recommended cooking time.</p>

				<br>
				
				<h2>Indirect Method</h2>
				<p>The Indirect Method is similar to roasting, but with the added benefits of that grilled texture, 
				flavor, and appearance you can't get from an oven. Heat rises, reflects off the lid and inside 
				surfaces of the grill, and slowly cooks the food evenly on all sides. The circulating heat works 
				much like a convection oven, so there's no need to turn the food. Use the Indirect Method for foods 
				that require 25 minutes or more of grilling time or for foods that are so delicate that direct exposure 
				to the heat source would dry them out or scorch them. Examples include roasts, ribs, whole chickens, 
				turkeys, and other large cuts of meat, as well as delicate fish fillets.</p>

				<p>To grill by the Indirect Method on a charcoal grill, arrange hot coals evenly on either side of the 
				charcoal grate. A drip pan placed in the center of the charcoal grate between the coals is useful to 
				collect drippings that can be used for gravies and sauces. It also helps prevent flare-ups when cooking 
				fattier foods such as goose, duck, or fatty roasts. For longer cooking times, add water to the drip pan 
				to keep drippings from burning. Place the cooking grate over the coals and place the food on the 
				cooking grate, centered over the drip pan or empty space. Place the lid on the grill and lift it 
				only to baste or check for doneness at the end of the suggested cooking time.</p>

				<p>To grill by the Indirect Method on a gas grill, preheat the grill with all burners on High. 
				Then adjust the burners on each side of the food to the temperature noted in the recipe and turn 
				off the burner(s) directly below the food. For best results, place roasts, poultry, or large cuts 
				of meat on a roasting rack set inside a disposable heavy-gauge foil pan. For longer cooking times, 
				add water to the foil pan to keep drippings from burning.</p>

				<h2>Smoking Basics</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Hungry for great smoked flavor? Our guides below will get your fire started whether you're using a 
				charcoal grill, a gas barbecue, or a traditional smoker. We've got tips for beginners and a 
				comprehensive Smoking Woods Chart to match the right woods with specific foods. Check out our 
				list of recipes to get you started.</p>
				
				<h2>Getting Started</h2>
				<p><b><i>Woods:</i></b> Start by soaking wood chunks in water for at least one hour; chips 
				(including wine barrel chips) and aromatic twigs (grape vines or fruit wood twigs) 
				need only 30 minutes of soaking. Shake all excess water off woods before adding them 
				to your fire or smoker box. (See our chart below for available wood types.) You can 
				find smoking woods in hardware stores and home centers-or if you're lucky, in your 
				own backyard! Wine barrel chips are available in specialty food stores and gift shops, 
				and some hardware stores.</p>
				
				<p><b><i>Water:</i></b> Water adds moisture to the smoking process so meats come out 
				flavorful and tender. If you're using a traditional smoker with a water pan, try adding 
				barbecue sauce, marinades, wine, beer, fruit juices, or herbs and spices to the water pan 
				for additional flavor. Be sure to keep the water pan full. For large roasts and turkeys, 
				you may have to add water to the pan a couple of times throughout grilling. Check the water 
				pan when you add charcoal-a watering can makes replenishing easy. (Note: When smoking cheese, 
				add ice to the water pan so the cheese doesn't melt above it.) You can use a water pan with 
				charcoal and gas grills, too.</p>
				
				
				<p><b><i>Food:</i></b> Place food in the center of the cooking grate above the water pan 
				(if you are using one). Remember that smoke and heat escape every time you peek into the grill, 
				so add 15 minutes to cooking time for each peek (more if you are smoking in cold weather). 
				Boneless meats, such as beef brisket and pork shoulder, will shrink considerably during smoke-cooking, 
				unless they have a heavy layering of fat. Simply cut off the fat before serving. 
				(Note: Consider cooking your menu up to two days before serving. The smoke flavor becomes richer 
				after a day or two in the refrigerator. That's why smoked foods make great leftovers.) All Weber 
				recipes are based on 70-degree weather with little or no wind at average altitudes, so add more 
				cooking time for wind, cold, and high altitudes.</p>
				
				
				<p><b><i>Preparing your Charcoal Grill, Gas Barbecue, or Traditional Smoker:</i></b> Virtually all 
				Weber Gas Barbecues can be equipped with or are sold with a smoker attachment (exceptions: Spirit 
				Series and Genesis Junior). The smoker attachment makes it easy to turn your barbecue grill into a 
				hot smoker. You can also improvise with a foil pan. Before preheating your grill, simply fill the 
				water pan on the smoker attachment with hot tap water. Place presoaked wood chunks or chips/twigs 
				in the other compartment, or in a foil pan directly on the Flavorizer Bars over the lit burner. 
				(Use a separate pan for water if you are using a foil pan for the wood pieces.) Begin cooking after 
				preheating and when grill is fully smoking. You can get a smoker attachment for your grill by visiting 
				your local dealer, or calling Weber Customer Service at 1-800-446-1071. Please have your grill model number available.</p>
				
				
				<p><b><i>Smoker:</i></b> Always position smoker on a level, heatproof surface away from buildings and out of traffic patterns. 
				It's best to find a place away from the house, since smoke aromas can linger for hours. Weber's Smokey Mountain Cooker Smoker 
				has three grates-one for charcoal and two for food-and a water pan. To prepare the smoker, heap charcoal in the center of the 
				charcoal grate, ignite the coals, and when coals have a light coating of grey ash, spread them evenly across the inside of the 
				charcoal chamber. Check recipe for number of charcoal layers needed. If you are using the water pan, place it on the lower bracket 
				of the center ring and fill it with hot tap water. Add seasonings to water, if desired.</p>
				
				<p>Place soaked woods on the coals through the door on the front of the smoker. Keep all vents partially closed for smoke-cooking. 
				Place food on the top and/or middle cooking grate, depending on recipe and food quantity. Arrange food in a single layer on each grate, 
				leaving space for smoke to circulate around each piece. Add 12 to 14 briquets and as many wood chunks as needed to fire, and replenish 
				water and seasonings.</p>

				<h2>Chef's Tips For Beginners</h2>
				<p><b><i>Use a meat thermometer to make sure smoke-cooked foods are done but not overcooked.</i></b> Smoke-cooked foods look different 
				than other grilled or oven-prepared foods. They may be pink or red when completely cooked 
				(apple wood especially will make chicken look red, for example).</p>
				
				<p><b><i>Use tongs and barbecue mitts</i></b>  to add charcoal, turn meats, refill the water pan, or adjust vents.</p>
				
				<p><b><i>Do not use charcoal infused with starter fluid-</i></b>it can add an unpleasant taste to your smoked foods.</p>
				
				<p><b><i>Experiment with different woods and meats</i></b> until you find the right combination for your tastes.</p>
				
				<p><b><i>Start with a small amount of wood</i></b> to see how you like the flavor, then add more for more intense smoky taste. 
				(Just don't overdo it; too much wood smoke over long periods can make food taste bitter.)</p>
				
				<p><b><i>Try combining woods</i></b> as you get more experienced for unique and flavorful results.</p>
				
				<p><b><i>Keep a smoker's notebook while experimenting.</i></b> Jot down ingredients, wood amounts and combinations, and results so you can repeat successes. 
				(Unless, of course, you want to keep your best recipes a secret!)</p>
